WELCOME TO SPLASH
========================

Ever get tired of Steam's outdated ways of how they sell video games? Congratulations, you've discovered Splash! 

Splash is a video game digital distribution service by Flatiron Studios. It was launched as a standalone software client in May 2020 as a way for Flatiron Studios to provide automatic updates for their games, and expanded to include games from third-party publishers.

## Setup and Usage

In order to join Splash, you must run: bundle install within your console.

Now that you have your equipment, please type: ruby bin/run.rb within your console. That will begin the text prompts that will lead you through information for both developers and gamers. You will find top sellers, games by companies, statistics, and more!

Please excuse the dust as we work on becoming beyond fabulous appearance wise compared to our old cousin.
